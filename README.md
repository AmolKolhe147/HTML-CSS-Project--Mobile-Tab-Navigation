# Mobile Tab Navigation

**## HTML Part**

- **Div** phone is created inside the body and Inside this div i have placed **4 Images** to show in the four tabs of Mobile device i.e - **Home,Work,Blog,About Us**.

- After the div **nav** bar is created for **Home,Work,Blog,About Us**. Inside this nav bar i have created one **Unordered-List**.

**## CSS Part**

- First I have applied **Box-Sizing** property.

- Applied some properties on body - **background-color,display,justify content,align-items,height, etc**.

- **On Div - phone** i have applied some css - **position,border,border-radius,height,width etc.**

- Then some proprties set for **class - content** on div phone. **Opacity,top,width,height,width,position,transition etc.**

-**nav** bar set the properties - **position,bottom,left,margin,top and width**.

-**ul** in nav bar set the properties - **background-color,display,paddig,margin and height etc.**

-**li inside nav** set the proprties - **Color,flex,cursor,padding,txt-align.**

- At the end we have set the properties on **p tag** inside li of nav and then on hover of tabs we have set the color.

**## JavaScript Part**

- On the click of every tab of Mobile navigation we have applied show and hide properties. When we click on any tab it shows an different images in every tab.

- We have used **querySelector** to select all the images using **class content**. Also we have selected the **ul list** inside the **nav** using querySelector.

- I have created two functions **hideAllItems** to hide all the images and ul list.

- Then i have created one more function to show only clicked part of Mobile tab navigation and other everything will be hide.
